# WAN Automation Examples

## Introduction

This repository provides Python and Terraform examples for interacting
with Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager and the Meraki Dashboard APIs.
Explore practical demonstrations for automating network configurations, monitoring, and integrations.

Please note these examples are for demonstration purposes only and not production-ready.

For guided Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN lessons, API concepts, configuration and
monitoring workflows, and hands-on lab material, visit the
[Catalyst SD-WAN API Learning Hub](https://ciscodevnet.github.io/catalyst-sdwan-api-hub/).
For the product API reference, see the
[official Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN API documentation](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/sdwan/).

The Bruno collections are stored beside the Python and Terraform examples for
their respective platforms. [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) is a local-first
API client that keeps collections in Git-friendly text files.

## Setup Python Environment

Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) with standalone installers:

```shell
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```shell
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Initialize and install dependencies:

```shell
uv sync
```

This initializes your environment by adding packages specified in the pyproject.toml file, ensuring all dependencies are installed as defined for your project.
