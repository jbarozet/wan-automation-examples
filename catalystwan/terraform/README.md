# SD-WAN Terraform Examples

This folder provides Terraform examples for interacting with Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager APIs,
using the SD-WAN Terraform Provider as well as the SD-WAN Terraform modules for even better abstraction.

Please note these examples are for demonstration purposes only and not production-ready.

## Overview

When working with Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager APIs using Terraform, you have two primary approaches: directly leveraging the CiscoDevNet/sdwan provider or utilizing the higher-level netascode/nac-sdwan/sdwan module. Both serve the purpose of automating SD-WAN configurations, but they operate at different levels of abstraction.

### SDWAN Terraform Provider

The CiscoDevNet/sdwan Terraform Provider:

- [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/sdwan/latest)
- [Github Repository](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/terraform-provider-sdwan)

**What it is:**

A Terraform provider is a plugin that Terraform uses to interact with an API of a specific service or platform. The CiscoDevNet/sdwan provider is the fundamental building block for managing Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN configurations with Terraform. It directly exposes the underlying Catalyst SD-WAN Manager (vManage) APIs as Terraform resources.

**How it works:**

When you use this provider, you define individual SD-WAN components (like VPNs, policies, templates, devices) as distinct Terraform resources. Each resource in your .tf files directly maps to an API call to vManage. This approach gives you granular control over every aspect of your SD-WAN configuration.

**Use Case:**

This option is ideal for users who need fine-grained control, want to manage specific SD-WAN objects directly, or are integrating with existing automation workflows that require direct API interaction. It's also the foundation upon which higher-level modules are built.

### SDWAN Terraform Module

The netascode/nac-sdwan/sdwan Terraform Module:

- [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/netascode/nac-sdwan/sdwan/latest)
- [Github Repository](https://github.com/netascode/terraform-sdwan-nac-sdwan)
- [Github - Pre-deployment validation tool](https://github.com/netascode/iac-validate)

**What it is:**

A Terraform module is a container for multiple resources that are used together. The netascode/nac-sdwan/sdwan module provides a higher level of abstraction over the CiscoDevNet/sdwan provider. It's designed to simplify complex SD-WAN configurations by allowing you to define your desired state using YAML configuration files.

**How it works:**

Instead of defining each individual resource (e.g., a VPN, then an interface, then a policy attachment) separately in HCL (Terraform's language), this module allows you to describe your entire SD-WAN intent in a more human-readable YAML format. The module then takes this YAML input, translates it into the necessary CiscoDevNet/sdwan provider resources, and provisions them on vManage. This approach often reduces the amount of boilerplate HCL code you need to write.

**Use Case:**

This option is excellent for users who prefer a more declarative, "intent-based" approach to SD-WAN configuration. It's particularly useful for quickly deploying common SD-WAN patterns, managing configurations from a single YAML source, and simplifying the overall Terraform code for complex deployments. It abstracts away many of the underlying provider details, making it easier to manage the entire SD-WAN fabric.

## Folders

- `provider`: example leveraging CiscoDevNet/sdwan Terraform Provider:
- `model`: example leveraging netascode/nac-sdwan/sdwan Terraform Module

## Terraform Model

Go to `model` folder.

Copy `config-example.yaml` to `config.yaml` and fill in parameters.

Initialize Terraform (this will download provider and module):

```shell
terraform init
```

Deploy devices configuration:

```shell
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

Once finished, delete configuration:

```shell
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

## Terraform provider

Go to `provider` folder.

Copy `config-example.yaml` to `config.yaml` and fill in parameters.

Initialize Terraform (this will download provider and module):

```shell
terraform init
```

Deploy devices configuration:

```shell
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

Once finished, delete configuration:

```shell
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

## Upgrade sdwan provider

To upgrade the latest acceptable version of each provider, use:

```shell
terraform init -upgrade
```

## Debug

You need to specify those two commands before running TF:

```shell
export TF_LOG_PATH=file.log
export TF_LOG=TRACE
```

This will save logs to file.log in the folder where you run terraform.
